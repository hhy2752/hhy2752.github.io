  summary: Spin fermion model is an effective model to describe metallic antiferromagnetic correlations observed in iron-based superconductors, consisting of both itinerant electrons and localized spins. I am using this model to investigate the antiferromagnetic order in the iron vacancy compound KFe<sub>1.5</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>.<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Calculated the total energy of experimentally observed antiferromagnetic ordered KFe<sub>1.5</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> with other hypothetical magnetic orders, verified that the experimentally observed one indeed has lower energy.</li><li>Calculated the total energy of these magnetic orders in the spin fermion model, found that the experimentally observed one is more stable. (In order to do a more realistic calculation, we extracted the tight binding parameter from DFT calculation of nonmagnatic FeSe, consisting of both Fe's 3d orbital and Se's 4p orbital)</li><li>Currently working on coming up with a simple picture that explained the stablization of experimentally observed antiferromagnetic order</li>

  summary: In the superconducting compound CaFeAs<sub>2</sub>, arsenic has an unusual average valence of As<sup>2-</sup>. I investigated its origin from electronic properties of CaFeAs<sub>2</sub>.<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Performed first-principles calculations on CaFeAs<sub>2</sub>, anaylized its band structure, density of states, electron density</li><li>Found that arsenic atoms from As layer and FeAs layer form different energy bands, and have valence counts of As<sup>-</sup> and As<sup>3-</sup> respectively, resulting in the As<sup>2-</sup> valence in average.</li>
